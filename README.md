# Decision Tree with PySpark

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using PySpark. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a decision tree model, evaluate its performance, and visualize results in a scalable environment.

---

## Features

* Data preprocessing with **PySpark DataFrame API**
* Feature engineering with **VectorAssembler**
* Train/test split and model training with **DecisionTreeClassifier**
* Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics
* Export and visualization of the trained decision tree

## Repository Structure

```
├── decision_tree_pyspark_prac7.ipynb   # Main Jupyter notebook
├── README.md                           # Project documentation
└── requirements.txt (optional)         # Python dependencies
```

---

##  Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Apache Spark (PySpark)
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas, matplotlib (for additional visualization)

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install pyspark pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

---

##  Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/decision-tree-pyspark.git
   cd decision-tree-pyspark
   ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open and run the notebook:

   ```
   decision_tree_pyspark_prac7.ipynb
   ```

---

## Example Workflow

1. Load dataset into a Spark DataFrame
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Assemble features into a vector column
4. Train a Decision Tree Classifier
5. Evaluate accuracy and performance metrics
6. Visualize the tree structure

---

## Results

* Accuracy: *to be filled in*
* Confusion Matrix: *to be filled in*
* Example prediction outputs: *to be added*

👉 Would you like me to also create a **requirements.txt** file for this repo so you can include it alongside the README?
